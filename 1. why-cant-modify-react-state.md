# Q:
Why React component state shouldn't be modified directly?
(Why React component state should be immutable?)

# A:
The way React component work is: when state changes, the view should automatically re-renders
itself respect to the new state.

React uses shallow equality checking to detect state change as simple as `===`, because a deep
equality check is expensive.

When it comes to `Object` type state, if the state can be modified directly, it will be impossible to 
do shallow equality checking, for example:
```
const state = {age: 9}

// modify the state directly
state.age = 20

// although state's age prop has changed, from shallow equality checking perspective it has not changed
state === state // true
```
