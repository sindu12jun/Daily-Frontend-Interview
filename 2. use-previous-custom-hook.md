# Q:
Please write a React custom hook, which can return the previous value of props or state.
Please explain why it works.

# A:
```
const usePrevious = (value) => {
  const ref = useRef();
  useEffect(() => {
    ref.current = value;
  }, value);
  return ref.current;
}
```
Because the object `ref` returned by `useRef()` persist for the full lifetime of the component, 
that is, the `.current` property value won't change until being changed explicitly.

So the only chance the `ref.current` change in this code is in the `useEffect` when `value` 
change, however `useEffect` is **called after DOM render**, so this hook would return previous value
before the `ref.current` keep up to the latest value.
