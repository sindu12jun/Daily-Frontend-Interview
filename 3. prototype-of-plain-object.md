# Q: 
What will this script print? Please explain why.

```
function Dog() {
  this.name = 'puppy'
}
Dog.prototype.bark = () => {
  console.log('woof!woof!')
}
const dog = new Dog()
dog.prototype.bark()
```

# A: 
An Uncaught TypeError will be thrown: 
```
Cannot read property 'bark' of undefined
```
Because the property `prototype` only make sense(exists) on a Function, it is the prototype of 
the instances constructed by that function.

When it comes to normal objects, `__proto__` is the actual property to lookup chain to the prototype.
So the last line can be fixed to:
```
function Dog() {
  this.name = 'puppy'
}
Dog.prototype.bark = () => {
  console.log('woof!woof!')
}
const dog = new Dog()
dog.__proto__.bark()
```
